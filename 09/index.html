                    React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React and
                    the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs
                    APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:
                    <span>bundles
                        of reusable, nestable code.</span> You can learn more about React in the next section. But
                    first, let‚Äôs
                    cover how components work in React Native.

                    React Native runs on <span>React</span>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces
                    with
                    JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can
                    get you started or can serve as a refresher course.

                    We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:

                <p class="chapter3-3">
                    <b>+ components.</b> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its examples: friendly,
                    approachable creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter3-4">
                    <b>+ JSX.</b> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write elements inside JavaScri
                    pt like
                    so:
                <p>
                    &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat! &lt;/Text&gt;.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p class="chapter3-5">
                    The React docs have <span class="chapter3-5-1">a comprehensive guide to JSX</span> you can refer to
                    learn even more. Because JSX is
                    JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span>name</span> for the cat,
                    name, and
                    embedding it with curly braces inside <span>&lt;Text&gt;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="chapter3-6">
                    <b>+ props.</b> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>+ state.</b> While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components
                    render, state
                    is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                    time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!

                    TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an
                    <span>onChangeText</span> prop that
                    takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a
                    function to be called when the text is submitted.
                </p>
                <p class="chapter4-2">
                    For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                    language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                    "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".
